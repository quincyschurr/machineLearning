    "The dataset that we will be using for Lab 3 was obtained from a Kaggle competition called Bago of Words Meets Bag of Popcorn. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data. The test dataset has 25,000 records that contain an id and then a review. The labeled training dataset contains 25,000 records that include an id, a sentiment score, and a review. The sentiment score is a binary value where 1 is a positive review, given if the rating on IMDB was greater than or equal to 7, and 0 is a negative review, given if the rating on IMDB was less than 5. For this lab we will be classifying the movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis.\n",

    "The purpose of this dataset is a tutorial learning dataset for learning sentiment analysis. "
