    "The dataset that we will be using for Lab 3 was obtained from a Kaggle competition called Bago of Words Meets Bag of Popcorn. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is comprised of 3 files, the test dataset, the unlabeled training dataset, and the labeled training dataset. For this lab we will be using the test and labeled training datasets. The test dataset has 25,000 records that contain an id and then a review. The labeled training dataset contains 25,000 records that include an id, a sentiment score, and a review. The sentiment score is a binary value where 1 is a positive review, given if the rating on IMDB was greater than or equal to 7, and 0 is a negative review, given if the rating on IMDB was less than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this dataset is understanding sentiment analysis through deep learning architectures. This means that the machine is learning how interpret the meaning behind an expression by learning how language is constructed and then trying to piece together patterns to determine whether an expression is positive or negative in meaning. The dataset was made public to users of Kaggle so that they could learn how to use deep learning architectures in order to classify or predict what people mean when they say certain things or predict what they could say next based on previous things they have said. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab we will be classifying the movie reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. Since the dataset was already split into a test and training set, we do not have to preprocess the data in order to split it up. We will be choosing two deep learning architectures to run our data through and will be testing the accuracy of each of the architectures. We will also be tuning the hyperparameters to try to obtain the best accruacy for each architecture. "

Testing accuracy is the best measure with this dataset becuase we are classifying the movie reviews into two categories and we were either correct or incorrect.
