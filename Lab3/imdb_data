Hi!

We're in the process of reviewing how we make our data available to the
outside world with the goal of making it easier for anyone to innovate
and answer interesting questions with the data. Since you're reading
this, you use our current ftp solution to get data (or are thinking
about it) and we'd love to get your feedback on the current process for
accessing data and what we could do to make it easier for you to use in
the future. We have some specific questions below, but would be just as
happy hearing about how you access and use IMDb data to make a better
overall experience.

Please head over to
https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/api_bulk_data_access to let us
know what you think.

Questions

1. What works/doesn't work for you with the current model?
2. Do you access entertainment data from other sources in addition to IMDb?
3. Would a single large data set with primary keys be more or less useful to you than the current access model? Why?
4. Would an API that provides access to IMDb data be more or less useful to you than the current access model? Why?
5. Does how you plan on using the data impact how you want to have it delivered?
6. Is JSON format sufficient for your use cases (current or future) or would additional format options be useful? Why?
7. Are our T&Cs easy for you to understand and follow?


Thanks for your time and feedback!

Regards,
